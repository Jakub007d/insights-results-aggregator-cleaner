// Simple service that can be used to identify clusters, for which we are
// keeping very old data (>30 days) in the database. This means that the
// cluster is no longer available or that the customer has disabled the
// Insights Operator, either way it means that these data are no longer
// relevant to us and should be pruned.
//
// Such clusters can be detected very easily by checking the timestamps stored
// (along other information) in the `report` table in Insights Results
// Aggregator database.
//
// Currently this service just displays such clusters (cluster IDs) and do
// nothing else - i.e. the results are not deleted.
