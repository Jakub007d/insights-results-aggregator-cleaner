Poc: Ability to remove all data for given cluster ID

        As an admin of CCX I need to remove all data from the external data
        pipeline for given cluster ID to be able to clean up wrong data,
        outdated data, data for the whole customer/company etc.

    Proposed solution
        * OS job accepting list of clusters from source repo
        * Simplest solution
        * Git history, git diff, git show, git blame etc. is there for free
        * Need to be deployed on demand by changing # pods
